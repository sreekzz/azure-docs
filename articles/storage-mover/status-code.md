# Troubleshooting Storage Mover job run error codes

An Azure Storage Mover agent uses string status codes for statuses that are conveyed to the end user. All status codes have the prefix *AZSM* followed by four decimal digits. The first decimal digit indicates the high-level scope of the status. Each status code should belong to one of the following scopes:

- Status that applies to the entire agent.<br />These codes use the scope digit '0', and therefore and have the prefix "AZSM0".
- Status that applies to a specific job run by the agent.<br />These codes use the scope digit '1' and therefore have the prefix "AZSM1".
- Status that applies to a specific file or directory transferred by a job run by the agent.<br />These codes use the scope digit '2' and therefore have the prefix "AZSM2".

Each of these scopes further divides statuses into categories and subcategories. Each subcategory typically reserves 20 status codes to accommodate future expansion.

> [!TIP]
> *AZSM0000* is the special scope-agnostic status code indicating successful operation. This should be used to signify successful operation at any scope/level.

|Error Code                       |Error Message | Details/Troubleshooting steps/Mitigation |
|---------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| <a name="AZSM1001"></a>AZSM1001 |Failed to mount source path | Verify the provided server information, name or IP-address, is valid, or the source location is correct. |
| <a name="AZSM1002"></a>AZSM1002 |Encountered an error while scanning the source  | Retry or create a support ticket. |
| <a name="AZSM1003"></a>AZSM1003 |Failed to access source folder due to permission issues | Check if the agent has been granted permissions correctly to the source file share. |
| <a name="AZSM1004"></a>AZSM1004 |Source path provided is invalid | Create a new endpoint with a valid source share path and update the job definition and retry. |
| <a name="AZSM1020"></a>AZSM1020 |Miscellaneous error while accessing source  | Retry or create a support ticket. |
| <a name="AZSM1021"></a>AZSM1021 |Failed to access target folder due to permission issues  | Retry or create a support ticket. |
| <a name="AZSM1022"></a>AZSM1022 |Target path provided is invalid | Create a new endpoint with a valid target container and path and update the job definition and retry. |
| <a name="AZSM1023"></a>AZSM1023 |Lease expired for this agent on the target container  | Retry or create a support ticket. |
| <a name="AZSM1024"></a>AZSM1024 |Authorization failure on claiming the target container | The agent doesn't have the permission to access the target container. The role assignment is performed automatically while running jobs from the portal. If you're using the APIs/Powershell cmdlets/SDKs, then manually create a 'Storage Blob Data Contributor' role assignment for the agent to access the target storage account blob container. The [Assign an Azure role for access to blob data](/azure/storage/blobs/assign-azure-role-data-access) article may help resolve this issue. |
| <a name="AZSM1025"></a>AZSM1025 |Authentication failure on claiming the target container  | Retry or create a support ticket. |
| <a name="AZSM1026"></a>AZSM1026 |Blob type in the target container not supported by the agent | This blob type is unsupported by the current Storage Mover agent. |
| <a name="AZSM1040"></a>AZSM1040 |Miscellaneous error while accessing target  | Retry or create a support ticket. |
| <a name="AZSM1041"></a>AZSM1041 |Failed to send job progress  | Retry or create a support ticket. |
