# Add vector fields to a search index

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Vector search is in public preview under [supplemental terms of use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). It's available through the Azure portal, preview REST API, and [alpha SDKs](https://github.com/Azure/cognitive-search-vector-pr#readme).

In Azure Cognitive Search, vector data is indexed as *vector fields* within a [search index](search-what-is-an-index.md), using a *vector configuration* to create the embedding space. 

+ A vector field is of type `Collection(Edm.Single)` so that it can hold  single-precision floating-point values. It also has a "dimensions" property and a "vectorConfiguration" property.

+ A vector configuration specifies the algorithm and parameters used during indexing to create the proximity graph. Currently, only Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) is supported.

During indexing, HNSW determines how closely the vectors match and stores the neighborhood information among vectors in the index. You can have multiple configurations within an index if you want different HNSW parameter combinations. As long as the vector fields contain embeddings from the same model, having a different vector configuration per field has no effect on queries.

## Prerequisites

+ Azure Cognitive Search, in any region and on any tier.

  Most existing services support vector search. For a small subset of services created prior to January 2019, an index containing vector fields fails on creation. In this situation, a new service must be created.

+ Pre-existing vector embeddings in your source documents. Cognitive Search doesn't generate vectors. We recommend [Azure OpenAI embedding models](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#embeddings-models) but you can use any model for vectorization. 

+ You should know the dimensions limit of the model used to create the embeddings and how similarity is computed. For **text-embedding-ada-002**, the length of the numerical vector is 1536. Similarity is computed using `cosine`.

> [!NOTE]
> During query execution, your workflow must call an embedding model that converts the user's query string into a vector. Be sure to use the same embedding model for both queries and indexing. For more information, see [Create and use embeddings for search queries and documents](vector-search-how-to-generate-embeddings.md).

## Prepare documents for indexing

Prior to indexing, assemble a document payload that includes fields of vector and non-vector data. The document structure must conform to the index schema. 

Make sure your documents:

1. Provide a field or a metadata property that uniquely identifies each document. All search indexes require a document key. To satisfy document key requirements, your documents must have one field or property that is unique in the index. This field must be mapped to type `Edm.String` and `key=true` in the search index. 

1. Provide vector data (an array of single-precision floating point numbers) in source fields.

   Vector fields contain numeric data generated by embedding models, one embedding per field. We recommend the embedding models in [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access), such as **text-embedding-ada-002** for text documents or the [Image Retrieval REST API](/rest/api/computervision/2023-02-01-preview/image-retrieval/vectorize-image) for images.

1. Provide other fields with human-readable alphanumeric content for the query response, and for hybrid query scenarios that include full text search or semantic ranking in the same request. 

Your search index should include fields and content for all of the query scenarios you want to support. Suppose you want to search or filter over product names, versions, metadata, or addresses. In this case, similarity search isn't especially helpful. Keyword search, geo-search, or filters would be a better choice. A search index that includes a comprehensive field collection of vector and non-vector data provides maximum flexibility for query construction and response composition.

A short example of a documents payload that includes vector and non-vector fields is in the [load vector data](#load-vector-data-for-indexing) section of this article.

## Add a vector field to the fields collection

The schema must include fields for the document key, vector fields, and any other fields that you require for hybrid search scenarios.

### [**Azure portal**](#tab/portal-add-field)

You can use the index designer in the Azure portal to add vector field definitions. If the index doesn't have a vector configuration, you're prompted to create one when you add your first vector field to the index.

Although you can add a field definition, there's no portal support for loading vectors into fields. Use the REST APIs or an SDK for data import.

1. [Sign in to Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open your search service page in a browser.

1. In the left-side navigation pane, select **Search management** > **Indexes**.

1. Select **+ Add Index** and give the index a name.

1. Select **Add Field**:

   :::image type="content" source="media/vector-search-how-to-create-index/portal-add-field.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add Field pane." border="true":::

   **Key points**:

   + Name the field (no spaces).
   + Choose type `Collection(Edm.Single)`.
   + Select "Retrievable" if you want the query to return the vector data in search results. If you have other fields with human readable content that you can return as a proxy for the match, you should set "Retrievable" to false to save space.
   + "Searchable" is mandatory for a vector field and can't be changed.
   + "Dimensions" is the length of the vector returned by the model. Set this value to specify `1536` for **text-embeddding-ada-002**, where the input text that you provide is numerically described using 1536 dimensions.

1. Select or create a vector configuration used for similarity search. If the index doesn't have a vector configuration, you must select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vector-search-how-to-create-index/portal-add-vector-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the vector configuration properties." border="true":::

   **Key points**:

   + Name the configuration. The name must be unique within the index.
   + "hnsw" is the Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithm used to create the proximity graph during indexing. Currently, only Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) is supported. 
   + "Bi-directional link count" default is 4. The range is 2 to 100. Lower values should return less noise in the results. 
   + "efConstruction" default is 400. It's the number of nearest neighbors used during indexing.
   + "efSearch default is 500. It's the number of nearest neighbors used during search.
   + "Similarity metric" should be "cosine" if you're using Azure OpenAI, otherwise use the similarity metric of the embedding model. Supported values are `cosine`, `dotProduct`, `euclidean`.

   If you're familiar with HNSW parameters, you might be wondering about "k" number of nearest neighbors to return in the result. In Cognitive Search, that value is set on the query request.

1. Select **Save** to save the vector configuration and the field definition.

### [**REST API**](#tab/rest-add-field)

In the following example, "title" and "content" contain textual content used in full text search and semantic search, while "titleVector" and "contentVector" contain vector data.

Updating an existing index with vector fields requires `allowIndexDowntime` query parameter to be `true`.

1. Use the [Create or Update Index Preview REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/preview-api/create-or-update-index) to create the index.

1. Add a `vectorSearch` section in the index that specifies the similarity algorithm used to create the embedding space. Currently, only `"hnsw"` is supported. For "metric", valid values are `cosine`, `euclidean`, and `dotProduct`. The `cosine` metric is specified because it's the similarity metric that the Azure OpenAI models use to create embeddings.

   ```json
    "vectorSearch": {
        "algorithmConfigurations": [
            {
                "name": "vectorConfig",
                "kind": "hnsw",
                "hnswParameters": {
                    "m": 4,
                    "efConstruction": 400,
                    "efSearch": 500,
                    "metric": "cosine"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
   ```

1. Add vector fields to the fields collection. You can store one generated embedding per document field. For each vector field:

   + Assign the `Collection(Edm.Single)` data type.
   + For `Collection(Edm.Single)`, the "filterable", "facetable", "sortable" attributes are "false" by default. Don't set them to "true" because those behaviors don't apply within the context of vector fields and the request will fail.
   + Provide the name of the vector search algorithm configuration.
   + Provide the number of dimensions generated by the embedding model.
   + "searchable" must be "true".
   + "retrievable" set to "true" allows you to display the raw vectors (for example, as a verification step), but doing so increases storage. Set to "false" if you don't need to return raw vectors. You don't need to return vectors for a query, but if you're passing a vector result to a downstream app then set "retrievable" to "true".

1. Add other fields that define the substance and structure of the textual content you're indexing. At a minimum, you need a document key. 

   You should also add fields that are useful in the query or in its response. The following example shows vector fields for title and content ("titleVector", "contentVector") that are equivalent to vectors. It also provides fields for equivalent textual content ("title", "content") useful for sorting, filtering, and reading in a search result.

   An index definition with the described elements looks like this:

    ```http
    PUT https://my-search-service.search.windows.net/indexes/my-index?api-version=2023-07-01-Preview&allowIndexDowntime=true

                "filterable": true
            },
            {
                "name": "title",
                "type": "Edm.String",
                "searchable": true,
                "filterable": true,

                "retrievable": true
            },

                "dimensions": 1536,
                "vectorSearchConfiguration": "vectorConfig"
            },
            {
                "name": "content",
                "type": "Edm.String",
                "searchable": true,
                "retrievable": true
            },
            {
                "name": "contentVector",
                "type": "Collection(Edm.Single)",
                "searchable": true,
                "retrievable": true,
                "dimensions": 1536,
                "vectorSearchConfiguration": "vectorConfig"
            }
        ],
        "vectorSearch": {
            "algorithmConfigurations": [
                {
                    "name": "vectorConfig",
                    "kind": "hnsw",
                    "hnswParameters": {
                        "m": 4,
                        "efConstruction": 400,
                        "efSearch": 500,
                        "metric": "cosine"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

## Load vector data for indexing

Content that you provide for indexing must conform to the index schema and include a unique string value for the document key. Vector data is loaded into one or more vector fields, which can coexist with other fields containing alphanumeric text.

You can use either [push or pull methodologies](search-what-is-data-import.md) for data ingestion. You can't use the portal for this step.

### [**Push APIs**](#tab/push)

Use the [Add, Update, or Delete Documents Preview REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/preview-api/add-update-delete-documents) to push documents containing vector data.

```http
POST https://my-search-service.search.windows.net/indexes/my-index/docs/index?api-version=2023-07-01-Preview
Content-Type: application/json
api-key: {{admin-api-key}}

            "category": "Web",
            "titleVector": [

            ],
            "@search.action": "upload"
        }
        . . .
    ]
}
```

### [**Pull APIs (indexers)**](#tab/pull)

Indexers can retrieve and index vector fields in source documents, assuming an index schema that meets vector field requirements and the preview REST API.

Data sources provide the vectors in whatever format the data source supports (such as strings in JSON). The indexer assumes that fields typed as `Collection(Edm.Single)` contain vectors and will index that content as vector indexes.

+ No changes to field mapping behavior or change detection for vectors. The behaviors for text indexing also apply to vectors.

+ If vector data is sourced in files, we recommend a nondefault `parsingMode` such as `json`, `jsonLines`, or `csv` based on the shape of the data. 

+ For data sources, [Azure blob indexers](search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage.md) and [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL indexers](search-howto-index-cosmosdb.md) with one of the above mention parsingModes have been tested and confirmed to work. 

  Azure SQL doesn't provide a way to store a collection natively as a single SQL column. A workaround hasn't been identified at this time.

+ The dimensions of all vectors from the data source must be the same and match their index definition for the field they're mapping to. The indexer throws an error on any documents that don’t match.

---

## Check your index for vector content

For validation purposes, you can query the index using Search Explorer in Azure portal or a REST API call. Because Cognitive Search can't convert a vector to human-readable text, try to return fields from the same document that provide evidence of the match. For example, if the vector query targets the "titleVector" field, you could select "title" for the search results.

### [**Azure portal**](#tab/portal-add-field)

You can use [Search Explorer](search-explorer.md) to query an index that contains vector fields. However, the query string in Search Explorer is plain text and isn't converted to a vector, so you can't use Search Explorer to test vector queries, but you can verify that data import occurred and that vector fields are populated with the expected numeric values.

Fields must be attributed as "retrievable" to be included in the results.

You can issue an empty search (`search=*`) to return all fields, including vector fields. You can also `$select` specific fields for the result set.

### [**REST API**](#tab/rest-add-field)

The following REST API example is a vector query, but it returns only non-vector fields (title, content, category). Only fields marked as "retrievable" can be returned in search results.

```http
POST https://my-search-service.search.windows.net/indexes/my-index/docs/search?api-version=2023-07-01-Preview
Content-Type: application/json
api-key: {{admin-api-key}}
{
    "vector": {
        "value": [
            -0.009154141,
            0.018708462,
            . . . 
            -0.02178128,
            -0.00086512347
        ],
        "fields": "contentVector",
        "k": 5
    },
    "select": "title, content, category"
}
```
